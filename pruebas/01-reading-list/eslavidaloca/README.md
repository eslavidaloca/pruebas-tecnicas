# Svelte Library

Web page made with svelte to participate in the first challenge midudev proposed inside his page [`pruebas-tecnicas`](https://pruebastecnicas.com/). Due to my work I couldn't finished in time to participate but still I wanted to try svelte and create something with it.

This project is a SPA so there's only one page where you can see everything this project does. Hope you like it!

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
